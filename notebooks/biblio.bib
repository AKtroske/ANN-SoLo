  abstract = {The proteome informatics research group of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities conducted a study to assess the community's ability to detect and characterize peptides bearing a range of biologically occurring post-translational modifications when present in a complex peptide background. A data set derived from a mixture of synthetic peptides with biologically occurring modifications combined with a yeast whole cell lysate as background was distributed to a large group of researchers and their results were collectively analyzed. The results from the twenty-four participants, who represented a broad spectrum of experience levels with this type of data analysis, produced several important observations. First, there is significantly more variability in the ability to assess whether a results is significant than there is to determine the correct answer. Second, labile post-translational modifications, particularly tyrosine sulfation, present a challenge for most researchers. Finally, for modification site localization there are many tools being employed, but researchers are currently unsure of the reliability of the results these programs are producing.},

  abstract = {Fewer than half of all tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra acquired in shotgun proteomics experiments are typically matched to a peptide with high confidence. Here we determine the identity of unassigned peptides using an ultra-tolerant Sequest database search that allows peptide matching even with modifications of unknown masses up to $\pm$ 500 Da. In a proteome-wide data set on HEK293 cells (9,513 proteins and 396,736 peptides), this approach matched an additional 184,000 modified peptides, which were linked to biological and chemical modifications representing 523 distinct mass bins, including phosphorylation, glycosylation and methylation. We localized all unknown modification masses to specific regions within a peptide. Known modifications were assigned to the correct amino acids with frequencies $>$90\%. We conclude that at least one-third of unassigned spectra arise from peptides with substoichiometric modifications.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Tandem mass spectrometry provides the means to match mass spectrometry signal observations with the chemical entities that generated them. The technology produces signal spectra that contain information about the chemical dissociation pattern of a peptide that was forced to fragment using methods like collision-induced dissociation. The ability to predict these MS2 signals and to understand this fragmentation process is important for sensitive high-throughput proteomics research.

Results: We present a new tool called MS2PIP for predicting the intensity of the most important fragment ion signal peaks from a peptide sequence. MS2PIP pre-processes a large dataset with confident peptide-to-spectrum matches to facilitate data-driven model induction using a random forest regression learning algorithm. The intensity predictions of MS2PIP were evaluated on several independent evaluation sets and found to correlate significantly better with the observed fragment-ion intensities as compared with the current state-of-the-art PeptideART tool.

Availability: MS2PIP code is available for both training and predicting at http://compomics.com/.},

The cornerstone of proteomic technology is tandem mass spectrometry of peptides resulting from the digestion of protein mixtures. The fragmentation pattern of each peptide ion is captured in its tandem mass spectrum, which enables its identification and acts as a fingerprint for the peptide. Spectral libraries are simply searchable collections of these fingerprints, which have taken on an increasingly prominent role in proteomic data analysis. This review describes the historical development of spectral libraries in proteomics, details the computational procedures behind library building and searching, surveys the current applications of spectral libraries, and discusses the outstanding challenges.},

  abstract = {The unambiguous assignment of tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) to peptide sequences remains a key unsolved problem in proteomics. Spectral library search strategies have emerged as a promising alternative for peptide identification, in which MS/MS spectra are directly compared against a reference library of confidently assigned spectra. Two problems relate to library size. First, reference spectral libraries are limited to rediscovery of previously identified peptides and are not applicable to new peptides, because of their incomplete coverage of the human proteome. Second, problems arise when searching a spectral library the size of the entire human proteome. We observed that traditional dot product scoring methods do not scale well with spectral library size, showing reduction in sensitivity when library size is increased. We show that this problem can be addressed by optimizing scoring metrics for spectrum-to-spectrum searches with large spectral libraries. MS/MS spectra for the 1.3 million predicted tryptic peptides in the human proteome are simulated using a kinetic fragmentation model (MassAnalyzer version2.1) to create a proteome-wide simulated spectral library. Searches of the simulated library increase MS/MS assignments by 24\% compared with Mascot, when using probabilistic and rank based scoring methods. The proteome-wide coverage of the simulated library leads to 11\% increase in unique peptide assignments, compared with parallel searches of a reference spectral library. Further improvement is attained when reference spectra and simulated spectra are combined into a hybrid spectral library, yielding 52\% increased MS/MS assignments compared with Mascot searches. Our study demonstrates the advantages of using probabilistic and rank based scores to improve performance of spectrum-to-spectrum search strategies.},

  abstract = {Identifying peptides from mass spectrometric fragmentation data (MS/MS spectra) using search strategies that map protein sequences to spectra is computationally expensive. An alternative strategy uses direct spectrum-to-spectrum matching against a reference library of previously observed MS/MS that has the advantage of evaluating matches using fragment ion intensities and other ion types than the simple set normally used. However, this approach is limited by the small sizes of the available peptide MS/MS libraries and the inability to evaluate the rate of false assignments. In this study, we observed good performance of simulated spectra generated by the kinetic model implemented in MassAnalyzer (Zhang, Z. (2004) Prediction of low-energy collision-induced dissociation spectra of peptides. Anal. Chem. 76, 3908\textendash{}3922; Zhang, Z. (2005) Prediction of low-energy collision-induced dissociation spectra of peptides with three or more charges. Anal. Chem. 77, 6364\textendash{}6373) as a substitute for the reference libraries used by the spectrum-to-spectrum search programs X!Hunter and BiblioSpec and similar results in comparison with the spectrum-to-sequence program Mascot. We also demonstrate the use of simulated spectra for searching against decoy sequences to estimate false discovery rates. Although we found lower score discrimination with spectrum-to-spectrum searches than with Mascot, particularly for higher charge forms, comparable peptide assignments with low false discovery rate were achieved by examining consensus between X!Hunter and Mascot, filtering results by mass accuracy, and ignoring score thresholds. Protein identification results are comparable to those achieved when evaluating consensus between Sequest and Mascot. Run times with large scale data sets using X!Hunter with the simulated spectral library are 7 times faster than Mascot and 80 times faster than Sequest with the human International Protein Index (IPI) database. We conclude that simulated spectral libraries greatly expand the search space available for spectrum-to-spectrum searching while enabling principled analyses and that the approach can be used in consensus strategies for large scale studies while reducing search times.},

We performed a systematic comparison between spectral library searching and sequence database searching using a wide variety of data to better demonstrate, and understand, the superior sensitivity of the former observed in preliminary studies. By decoupling the effect of search space, we demonstrated that the success of spectral library searching is primarily attributable to the use of real library spectra for matching, without which the sensitivity advantage largely disappears. We further determined the extent to which the use of real peak intensities and non-canonical fragments, both under-utilized information in sequence database searching, contributes to the sensitivity advantage. Lastly, we showed that spectral library searching is disproportionately more successful in identifying low-quality spectra, and complex spectra of higher- charged precursors, both important frontiers in peptide sequencing. Our results answered important outstanding questions about this promising yet unproven method using well-controlled computational experiments and sound statistical approaches.},
